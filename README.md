### Milestone 12: My Products Page - Filtering by User Email  

✅ Goals:  

#### 1️⃣ Backend - Fetch Products by User Email  
- Created an API endpoint to retrieve only the products added by the logged-in user.  
- Used Express.js and Mongoose to filter products based on the user's email stored in MongoDB.  
- Ensured secure and efficient querying to fetch only relevant data.  

#### 2️⃣ Frontend - Fetch & Display User-Specific Products  
- Created a function to fetch products linked to the logged-in user's email.  
- Passed the received data to the existing Product Card Component.  
- Used .map() to dynamically render only the user's products on the "My Products" page.  

#### 3️⃣ Why This Matters?  
- Enables personalized product listings based on the logged-in user's email.  
- Improves data filtering skills, ensuring only relevant data is sent to the client.  
- Enhances user experience by displaying only their added products instead of all products.
